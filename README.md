# ChatGPT System Prompts

Welcome to the ChatGPT System Prompts repository! Here you can find a collection of system prompts for ChatGPT, a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. These prompts are designed to help developers steer the AI's behavior and customize the user experience within bounds.

## What are System Prompts?

System prompts are pre-defined messages that developers can use to steer the AI's behavior and task, rather than prompts for the user to interact with. They allow developers to customize the AI's style and task by describing those directions in the "system" message.

## How to Use These Prompts

To use these prompts, include the appropriate JSON object in your message to the AI. Each system prompt file in the `system-prompts/` directory contains the name of the prompt, a description of what the prompt does and how it affects the AI's behavior, and an example usage of the prompt in code or text form.
